# A Bitcoin Miner built on Python
This is a very simple bitcoin miner built on python, with the help of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html">hashlib</a> library in python.
## How to use it?
Simply download the file and run it on any Python IDE of your choice.
### NOTICE
THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE TO ACTUALLY MINE BITCOIN.
I don't know much about the blockchain or digital currencies in general, so i have no idea how to actually get BitCoin on your machine using this script, but feel free to contribute to this project.
